# The New Shape Library (Alpha version)

This is where all the entries that made it to semi-finals in the New Shape Prize are being iterated on. You can find them in the folder above called `global governance models`.

## How To Suggest Changes
1. Navigate to the entry in the `global governance models` folder.
2. Press the button that looks like a pen in the top right corner (you will get a tooltip `Edit this file`).
3. Make your desired changes to the entry. The file is in the format Markdown, if you're unfamiliar please see [this guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
4. Scroll down to the bottom of the page to the text `Commit changes`
5. Add a short descriptive title to your changes in the small input box. Example `Remove HTML code`
6. Add a short descriptive text describing the essence of what you're suggesting be changed. Example: `Some HTML code was not converted to Markdown, removing some of it with these proposed changed.`
7. Be sure the option `Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.` is selected.
8. Press the button `Propose file changes`. This will take you to a new screen with the title `Open a pull request`.
9. Press the button `Create pull request`.
10. You will be taken to a new view called a `Pull Request` where your changes will be viewable to everyone. We will then review the changes and reply in to you in that view. Keep track of your Github or email notifications.

### Important caveat
It is only after the 9th step that your changes are saved as proposed changes. In technical terms the changes are saved in a commit which is pushed to a remote branch and then presented as a `Pull Request`.
